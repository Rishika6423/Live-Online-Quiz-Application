# Live Online Quiz Application

## Project Idea

This project is an interactive online quiz platform where admins can create quizzes with private codes, and users can join and attempt them.  
Admins manage quizzes and view all users' scores, while users can participate and instantly see their results after submission.  
This version is a frontend-only implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with data stored in localStorage.
